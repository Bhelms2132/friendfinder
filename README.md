This app asks users to fill out their name, add a image link and gives the users 10 questions to answer ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).  Once the survey is filled out and submitted, the app will return a match for the user to the closest person that is in the app. 
Some issues that I ran into was wiring up the js script within the survey.html file.  I have not added a css file/ attributes to this app. The css will come later, once added I will update the readme.
